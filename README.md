Abstract
The project “covid 19 website” is an online website which gives us information about covid.COVID-19 is a type of coronavirus disease belonging to the family Coronaviridae. The disease is thought to originate from bats and was spread to people through an unknown medium in Wuhan, China. Ideally, the condition is spread by inhalation or close interaction with infected droplets that have an incubation period between two and fourteen days. Today, there are thousands of infections and deaths that have been caused by the disease. 
Moreover, the symptoms of the disease include fever, cough, sneezing, sore throat, difficulty breathing, and tiredness. Additionally, the diagnosis of the disease starts by gathering samples of the upper and lower respiratory tracts of the infected person. Also, chest X-rays and CT scan are used in the diagnosis stage. Basically, there is no precise treatment for the ailment, and this calls for the need to prevent the disease from spreading. Notable prevention strategies are isolation of the infected persons, proper ventilation, hand hygiene and use of personal protective equipment.
In this project, we are creating an Online web application, which is designed for the Covid19. It is an Online web application where users can find all important and mandatory Information at a single destination. The website will be completely efficient and transparent to the reviews of the people.
The website has a complete user interface attached to the API .

INTRODUCTION

CONTEXT
As technology advances internet is becoming ever popular. Website has become an essential part. Often website of an institution is used as major requirements to rate it. Thus having a website is essential for any one. On this project we will develop a website for the COVID-19 Stats. On this report almost every details that is necessary has been discussed. Although maximum effort has been given to estimate Cases and Conditions.
This project has been completed approximately three months and has been executed in modules, meetings have been organised to check the progress of the work and for instructions and guidelines. Overall a useful website can be really helpful for the All.

Motivation
As of now, researchers know that the coronavirus is spread through droplets and virus particles released into the air when an infected person breathes, talks, laughs, sings, coughs or sneezes. Larger droplets may fall to the ground in a few seconds, but tiny infectious particles can linger in the air and accumulate in indoor places, especially where many people are gathered and there is poor ventilation. This is why mask-wearing, hand hygiene and physical distancing are essential to preventing COVID-19.and we need to spread more and more awareness about it.
Objective
The main objective of this application is to create a COVID-19 information app named “COVID-19 Stas” Which gives latest update about Covid-19 . This app gives information about Total COVID-19 cases ,Total Deaths ,Total Number of people Recovered .
